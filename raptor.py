RAPTOR - Unified Security Testing Launcher

Single entry point for all RAPTOR capabilities:
- Static analysis (Semgrep + CodeQL)
- Binary fuzzing (AFL++)
- Web application scanning
- Autonomous LLM-powered analysis
- And more...

Usage:
    raptor.py <mode> [options]

Available Modes:
    scan        - Static code analysis (Semgrep + CodeQL)
    fuzz        - Binary fuzzing with AFL++
    web         - Web application security testing
    agentic     - Full autonomous workflow
    codeql      - CodeQL-only analysis
    doctor      - Status report for local setup (no claude needed)
    help        - Show detailed help for a specific mode

Examples:
    # Full autonomous workflow
    python3 raptor.py agentic --repo /path/to/code

    # Static analysis only
    python3 raptor.py scan --repo /path/to/code --policy-groups secrets,owasp

    # Binary fuzzing
    python3 raptor.py fuzz --binary /path/to/binary --duration 3600

    # Web scanning
    python3 raptor.py web --url https://example.com

    # CodeQL analysis
    python3 raptor.py codeql --repo /path/to/code --languages java

Available Modes:
  scan        - Static code analysis with Semgrep
  sca         - Software Composition Analysis (deps + advisories + SBOM)
  fuzz        - Binary fuzzing with AFL++
  web         - Web application security testing
  agentic     - Full autonomous workflow (Semgrep + CodeQL + LLM analysis)
  codeql      - CodeQL-only analysis
  analyze     - LLM-powered vulnerability analysis (requires SARIF input)
  doctor      - Status report for local setup (no claude needed)

Examples:
  # Full autonomous workflow
  python3 raptor.py agentic --repo /path/to/code

  # Static analysis only
  python3 raptor.py scan --repo /path/to/code --policy-groups secrets,owasp

  # Binary fuzzing
  python3 raptor.py fuzz --binary /path/to/binary --duration 3600

  # Web scanning
  python3 raptor.py web --url https://example.com

  # CodeQL analysis
  python3 raptor.py codeql --repo /path/to/code --languages java

  # LLM analysis of existing SARIF
  python3 raptor.py analyze --repo /path/to/code --sarif findings.sarif

Sandbox isolation (mode-level flags — pass them AFTER the mode name,
not before; the top-level parser does not declare them directly):
  --sandbox {full,debug,network-only,none}
                        Force a sandbox profile (default: full)
  --no-sandbox          Alias for --sandbox none
  --audit               Log what enforcement WOULD have blocked
                        (composes with --sandbox profiles other than 'none')
  --audit-verbose       With --audit, log every traced syscall
                        (strace-style diagnostic)

  Run ``python3 raptor.py <mode> --help`` to see them in the mode's
  own argparse-generated list (they are added by
  ``core.sandbox.add_cli_args``, not the top-level parser).

  # Examples
  python3 raptor.py agentic --repo /code --audit          # log + run
  python3 raptor.py scan --repo /code --sandbox debug     # gdb-friendly
  python3 raptor.py fuzz --binary /b --audit --audit-verbose  # full trace

  # Get help for a specific mode
  python3 raptor.py help scan
  python3 raptor.py help fuzz
  python3 raptor.py scan --help
