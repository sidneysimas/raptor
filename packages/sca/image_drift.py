"""Image capability-drift detector — SCA scan integration.

Substrate lives in :mod:`core.binary`:
  - :func:`core.binary.capability_fingerprint` — extract the
    fingerprint
  - :func:`core.binary.detect_drift` — diff two fingerprints
  - :func:`core.binary.save_fingerprint` / ``load_fingerprint``
    — persistent baseline store

This module wires those primitives into the SCA scan pipeline:
walks every image ref in the target, fingerprints its main
binary, compares against the stored baseline (if any), emits a
``SupplyChainFinding`` of kind ``image_capability_drift`` when
drift is detected, and updates the baseline.

Drift = re-tagged image whose digest moved to bytes with
different capabilities. The bumper can't catch this (no version
change in the manifest), but operators relying on mutable tags
like ``alpine:3.18`` get a warning when the bytes silently
change.
