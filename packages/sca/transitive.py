"""Transitive-dependency expansion orchestrator.

Mode (b) — cascade resolver in sandbox — is the default. The matching
resolver from ``packages/sca/resolvers/`` runs against the manifest's
parent dir and emits a real lockfile; we then parse those lockfile
bytes to extract the transitive dep set with exact resolved versions.

Mode (c) — registry-metadata recursive walk — is the opt-in fallback
(``--fallback-registry-metadata``) for when (b) can't run (toolchain
not in PATH, sandbox unavailable, resolver fails or times out, network
refusal at proxy). Approximation; emits findings tagged
``source_kind="metadata_walk"`` with low parser_confidence so
operators know to triage with caution.

Per-manifest, ecosystem-by-ecosystem decision tree:

  1. Sibling lockfile already present? → already parsed by the
     pipeline; skip orchestration.
  2. ``--no-resolve-transitive``? → skip; emit hygiene reason
     ``"resolver disabled by flag"``.
  3. Run (b) cascade resolver in sandbox.
     - success → parse generated lockfile bytes; emit transitives
       with ``source_kind="cascade_resolver"`` and high confidence.
     - skipped (toolchain unavailable) / failed (registry refused,
       resolver couldn't satisfy, timeout) → log specific reason,
       fall through.
  4. ``--fallback-registry-metadata`` enabled? → run (c). Approximation
     with low confidence.
  5. Else → skip; the existing ``lockfile_missing`` hygiene finding
     surfaces the gap.

Returns ``(transitive_deps, [TransitiveStatus, ...])``. Status rows
feed the operator-facing report so they can see, per ecosystem,
whether transitive coverage was real / approximate / missing-and-why.
