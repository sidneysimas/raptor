"""Source intelligence analyzer — orchestrates cocci rules + alias
scanning to produce structured evidence per target.

Phase 2 (substrate) ships exactly one axis: ``axis 1 / attrs`` covering
``warn_unused_result``. Axes 2-7 plug in by adding rule directories
under ``engine/coccinelle/source_intel/`` and aggregators here.

The output is a :class:`SourceIntelResult` (frozen) keyed on target +
rule-set hash. The Stage D LLM consumer consumes it via
:mod:`packages.source_intel.render`; the corpus runner consumes it
via :mod:`packages.source_intel.adapter`.

Hard invariants (carried from design):
  * Strict sidecar — produces evidence, never overrides verdict.
  * ``--no-includes`` to spatch by default (untrusted-target posture
    matching PR-3 cocci scan + PR-4 prereqs).
  * Out-of-tree symbols never fabricated — `function_attrs_status`
    explicit when a symbol isn't found.
