""":class:`Validator` adapter — wires source_intel into the corpus runner.

Phase 2 substrate ships a minimal verdict policy: source_intel is
fundamentally a SIDECAR (evidence, not verdict), so the Validator
returns ``UNCERTAIN`` for findings where structural evidence is
inconclusive — which is most findings until axes 2-7 ship. Specific
explicit-verdict cases:

  * Finding's function annotated WUR (literal or known alias) AND
    finding cites an unchecked-return-class CWE (CWE-252/CWE-476):
    EXPLOITABLE — author intent supports the claim. (Build-flag
    enforcement caveats are recorded in evidence but don't gate
    the verdict.)
  * All other cases: UNCERTAIN.

This minimal policy intentionally leaves room for axes 2-7 to refine
the verdict via the same Validator. The corpus runner records the
UNCERTAIN bucket separately — it doesn't contribute to precision /
recall, so Phase 2 lands without harming the V2 baseline.
