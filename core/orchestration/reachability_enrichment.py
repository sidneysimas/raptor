"""Reachability-driven checklist enrichment for /agentic.

Sibling of :func:`core.orchestration.understand_bridge.enrich_checklist`,
which marks entry-points and sinks as ``priority=high`` based on
the /understand context-map. This module marks dead-code
functions (NOT_CALLED verdict from
``core.inventory.reachability``) as ``priority=low`` so the
/agentic LLM analysis spends its budget on functions that
actually run.

The two enrichers are complementary:

  * ``enrich_checklist`` (understand_bridge): UPGRADES priority
    based on context-map data (entry points, sinks, trust
    boundaries).
  * ``mark_unreachable_low_priority`` (this module): DOWNGRADES
    priority for functions not reached from anywhere in non-test
    project source.

When both run, ``enrich_checklist`` should run FIRST so its
``priority=high`` markers stand. This module skips functions
already marked high-priority — the entry-point analysis trumps
reachability (a function might be an externally-callable entry
point that the project itself doesn't call internally; static
reachability would say NOT_CALLED but the operator still cares).

Mutates the checklist in place. Returns the count of functions
marked low-priority, mainly for diagnostic logging.

Best-effort: any failure (inventory build error, malformed
checklist, missing call_graph data) is logged at debug and the
checklist is returned unchanged.
