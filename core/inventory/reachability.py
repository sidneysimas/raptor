"""Function-level reachability resolver.

Answers "is qualified-function ``X.Y.Z`` actually called from this
project?" using the call-graph data captured by
:mod:`core.inventory.call_graph` and stored in the inventory
artefact.

The resolver is language-agnostic. The first-cut data producer
(``call_graph.extract_call_graph_python``) is Python-only, so
non-Python files contribute neither evidence-for nor evidence-
against — they're skipped as "no data". Other-language consumers
get added when a producer for that language ships.

## Verdict semantics

  * ``CALLED`` — at least one call site in non-test project code
    demonstrably resolves to the queried qualified name via its
    file's import map.
  * ``NOT_CALLED`` — no call site resolves to the qualified name,
    AND no file with a tail-name candidate has an indirection flag
    (``getattr`` / ``importlib.import_module`` / ``__import__`` /
    wildcard import) that could plausibly mask such a call.
  * ``UNCERTAIN`` — no call site resolves, but at least one file
    that could plausibly call this function uses indirection. We
    refuse to claim NOT_CALLED in that case.

Consumers translate UNCERTAIN to "do not downgrade severity" — it's
the safe choice for security work, where false-confidence in
non-reachability is the worst outcome.

## Out of scope (UNCERTAIN by design — documented, not "fix
later")

  * Decorator-driven dispatch, plugin registries, dynamic
    ``setattr`` injection.
  * Method dispatch on subclassed instances (e.g. subclass
    ``requests.Session``, override ``get``). This is *module-
    function* reachability, not method-resolution-order
    reachability.
  * String-based reflective dispatch beyond ``getattr`` /
    ``importlib`` / ``__import__`` (eval / exec / pickle / RPC).
  * Cross-package re-exports the resolver hasn't been told about.
    A package that re-exports ``requests.utils.extract_zipped_paths``
    as ``mypkg.helpers.ezp`` won't be matched on the
    ``mypkg.helpers.ezp`` qualified name unless the inventory
    captures the re-export — and at first cut, it doesn't.

If the consumer cares about any of those, CodeQL's call-graph
queries are the right tool — at the cost of a ~30s DB build.
This resolver is meant to be sub-second.

## Test-file exclusion

By default, files matching a test path pattern (``tests/``,
``test_*.py``, ``*_test.py``, ``conftest.py``) are NOT counted as
evidence-for. ``mock.patch("requests.get")`` mentions a qualified
name without calling it; counting test-file uses as CALLED would
keep severities pinned high purely because the project has good
test coverage. Pass ``exclude_test_files=False`` to opt out.

    Built once per inventory; ``function_called`` reuses across the
    many (dep × affected_function) queries every SCA function-level
    tier emits. Pre-fix the bare loop scanned all ~30k Grafana files
    for every query — 8 tiers × dozens of deps × multiple affected
    funcs/dep = tens of millions of file-record walks, the dominant
    cost of a 12-min reach stage. Indexed: only the small set of
    files that mention the target gets the per-file check.

    Conservatism: each bucket is over-inclusive, never under. A file
    in a bucket still pays the full per-file branch logic; a file
    NOT in any bucket has zero possible match under the existing
    semantics. False positives only cost cycles, not correctness.

    Buckets use sorted ``Tuple[int, ...]`` rather than ``FrozenSet[int]``
    — for the typical Grafana-shape distribution (64% of tokens hold
    one file, 27% hold 2–5) the tuple cuts per-bucket overhead from
    ~232 bytes (frozenset header + hash table) to ~64 bytes (tuple
    header). The consumer in ``function_called`` only iterates each
    bucket once into a set union; tuple iteration is faster than set
    iteration anyway, so there's no perf cost.

# Adjacency primitives — 1-hop callers / callees
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``function_called`` (above) answers "is some call site in the project
# resolved to ``X``?" — a *forward 1-hop* query specialised for external
# targets. Consumers like ``/audit`` need a richer set of primitives:
# given a project-internal function, who calls it and what does it call?
# Given a CVE-affected dep function, walk back to find every caller chain
# in the project.
#
# The primitives below are language-agnostic and operate on the same
# inventory shape ``function_called`` consumes. They share a per-
# inventory adjacency index built lazily on first query and memoised
# weakly so batch queries (every function in the project) amortise.
#
# **Node identity.** A node in the call graph is one of:
#
#   * :class:`InternalFunction` — a project-defined function. Identity:
#     ``(file_path, name, line)``. The line disambiguates same-name
#     overloads / nested defs / methods of different classes that
#     happen to share a name.
#
#   * :class:`ExternalFunction` — a dotted dep-name resolved via the
#     containing file's import map. Identity: ``qualified_name``.
#
# **Method-call policy.** When a call site's chain is rooted in a name
# that *isn't* in the file's import map — e.g. ``self.foo()``,
# ``obj.foo()`` — we can't know which class's ``foo`` was invoked. Two
# directions, two policies:
#
#   * **Caller direction (``callers_of``)**: over-inclusive. We add the
#     enclosing function as a candidate caller of every project
#     ``foo`` we know of. False positives in caller lists show up as
#     visible noise; missing a real caller can lead a downstream
#     consumer to demote a real vulnerability. Bias toward inclusion.
#
#   * **Callee direction (``callees_of``)**: under-inclusive +
#     UNCERTAIN flag. We don't enumerate every possible ``foo`` in the
#     project as a callee; instead we record an indirection-style
#     uncertainty entry on the result. ``/audit``'s context slice
#     would otherwise be flooded with non-callees.
#
# The asymmetry is deliberate. Documented; not "fix later".

# 1-hop adjacency (``callers_of`` / ``callees_of``) answers "who DIRECTLY
# calls X?" The closure primitives below answer the transitive question:
# given a target, which project functions can reach it through ANY chain
# of internal calls? Or symmetrically: from a set of entry points, what's
# the full forward-reachable set?
#
# All three primitives walk the same definitive call-graph edges captured
# by the adjacency index in pass 2. **Uncertain edges are NOT walked.**
# A consumer wanting "could-possibly-reach" coverage should drill into
# the boundary using ``callers_of`` / ``callees_of`` directly to inspect
# the 1-hop uncertain neighbours; closure semantics are "demonstrably
# reachable".
#
# This split is deliberate: the SCA / audit consumer that wants to demote
# severity for unreachable code wants to be conservative — empty closure
# under definitive-only walk, plus a non-empty 1-hop uncertain frontier,
# means "we don't know" and severity should NOT be demoted. The two
# halves of the answer come from separate primitives.
#
# **Termination at External nodes.** Forward closure expands
# InternalFunction nodes only — ``ExternalFunction`` is recorded in the
# closure when reached but its callees are unknown to the index (it's
# a dep). Reverse closure has no analogous distinction: every caller of
# anything is by definition an Internal project function (we don't
# index how the project's deps call each other).
#
# **Cycles.** Visited-set BFS handles cycles trivially. We don't surface
# strongly-connected-component structure — consumers that need it can
# layer it on top of a closure result.
