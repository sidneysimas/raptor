"""Backfill: fold per-run coverage records + inventory checked_by into the
persistent CoverageStore.

Producers keep emitting per-run ``coverage-record.json`` (file-level
``files_examined``) and the inventory keeps per-item ``checked_by``
(function-level, LLM-driven). The store is the durable union that survives
``/project clean``; this module is the bridge that imports both. Call
:func:`import_run_dir` per run, or :func:`backfill` over all run dirs once.

File-level marks need each file's line count (the inventory's ``lines``) to
place the whole-file interval; files absent from the inventory are skipped
(their extent is unknown). Granularity is therefore: whole-file from the
records, function-level from ``checked_by``. True line-level coverage
arrives only when a producer emits ranges -- a later format extension.
